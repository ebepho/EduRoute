# EduRoute – Navigation Meets Education  

> *Making newcomers locals, and locals experts.*  

EduRoute is an interactive mapping application that blends **navigation** with **education**. Instead of relying on a map for every trip, users **learn and memorize their routes** through gamified challenges, visual cues, and personalized practice.

## 🎯 Project Overview  
- **Audience:** Urban users traveling within a short radius (~4 km).  
- **Goal:** Help people **internalize their routes** rather than constantly checking a GPS.  
- **Approach:** Gamify navigation with multiple learning modes, visual design cues, and recall-based challenges.

## 🖥️ Features & UI  

### 📌 Core Features  
- **Dynamic Map Visualization** – Smooth zooming, intuitive colours, and icons.  
- **Game Modes:**  
  - **Classical Mode** → Quiz-style recall of routes.  
  - **Advanced Mode** → Delivery challenges, where users optimize paths across multiple stops.  
- **Pathfinding** – Algorithms like BFS, Dijkstra, and A* ensure efficient routing.  
- **Courier Optimization** – Greedy and heuristic search strategies (simulated annealing, 2-opt) solve multi-delivery problems.  

### 🎨 UI Design Choices  
- **High-contrast colour schemes** to aid memorization.  
- **Intuitive icons & buttons** for usability.  
- **Landmark recognition** – e.g., “Head towards the CN Tower” instead of only street names.  
- **Notifications & Alerts** – Mobile reminders if a user strays from their route.  
- **Leaderboards & Competition** – Motivates learning with a Duolingo-style experience.

## 🚀 Outcomes  
- A **functional and interactive map interface**.  
- A **gamified navigation tool** that makes route learning engaging.  
- An innovative bridge between **education, travel, and usability**.

## 📷 Screenshots  
These screenshots showcase the interactive elements of EduRoute:  

- **Classical Mode Quiz:** Users are quizzed on previously traveled routes, reinforcing memorization through active recall.  
- **Advanced Mode Delivery Challenge (GIFs below):** Demonstrates how users must optimize their path across multiple destinations, simulating real-world courier-style navigation.

## 🎨 Colour Scheme (Light vs Dark)  
EduRoute supports both **light** and **dark themes** for accessibility and user preference.  

- **Light Mode:** Optimized for clarity in well-lit environments, focusing on subtle contrasts.  
- **Dark Mode:** Reduces eye strain and highlights map features with vibrant accent colours.  
- Colour choices were carefully selected for **memorability** and **quick recognition**, ensuring users can absorb route information faster.

## 🖼️ Icons  
EduRoute uses a custom set of icons designed for **simplicity** and **clarity**.  

- Icons are deliberately **minimalist** to reduce clutter while still being recognizable at a glance.  
- They reinforce memorization by **matching real-world landmarks and map symbols**.  
- The consistent design language ensures that icons remain intuitive across different game modes and zoom levels.
